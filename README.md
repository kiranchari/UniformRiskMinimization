# Domain Generalization 
Please use this [fork](https://github.com/kiranchari/DomainBed/tree/URM) of the [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed) library to run URM for domain generalization. Passing ```--algorithm URM``` to the commands will run the URM algorithm when running experiments.
We have also created a pull request to merge the [forked repo](https://github.com/kiranchari/DomainBed/tree/URM) to the original [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed) library. 
You may check the original DomainBed library in case the pull request has been merged.

# Subpopulation robustness
Please use this [fork](https://github.com/kiranchari/SubpopBench/tree/URM) of the [SubpopBench](https://github.com/YyzHarry/SubpopBench) library to run URM for subpopulation shifts. Passing ```--algorithm URM``` to the commands will run the URM algorithm when running experiments.
We have also created a pull request to merge the [forked repo](https://github.com/kiranchari/SubpopBench/tree/URM) to the original [SubpopBench](https://github.com/YyzHarry/SubpopBench) library. 
You may check the original SubpopBench library in case the pull request has been merged.
