# Domain Generalization 
Please use this [fork](https://github.com/kiranchari/DomainBed/tree/URM) of the [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed) library to run URM for domain generalization.
We have also created a pull request to merge the [forked repo](https://github.com/kiranchari/DomainBed/tree/URM) to the original [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed) library. 
You may check the original DomainBed library in case it has been merged.
